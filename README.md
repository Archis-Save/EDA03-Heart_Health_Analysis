EDA03- Heart Health Analysis:- https://www.kaggle.com/code/archissave/eda03-heart-health-analysis  

This project demonstrates how data analytics can play a crucial role in preventing heart disease by identifying key risk factors and enabling early diagnosis. Through rigorous data preprocessing, advanced statistical analysis, and predictive modeling using logistic regression, the study achieved high data accuracy and showed strong predictive capability toward detecting potential heart disease cases. The insights generated can support healthcare providers in developing targeted treatment plans, promoting risk-aware lifestyles, and improving patient care strategies. By integrating data-driven decision-making into cardiology, this project highlights the potential to significantly reduce heart disease incidence and enhance public health outcomes.

This heart disease prediction project successfully identified key clinical and lifestyle risk factors that significantly influence cardiovascular health. Through detailed data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling, we observed that age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina are strong indicators of heart disease. The logistic regression model further demonstrated reliable predictive capability, enabling early risk detection.

By transforming clinical insights into actionable outcomes, this analysis supports data-driven decisions that can enhance preventive care, improve diagnostic accuracy, and contribute to reducing heart disease cases through timely medical intervention.
